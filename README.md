### Hi there 🙋🏾‍♂️

My name is **Samuel** (*but you can call me **Samuca***).</br>
I'm a software engineer at [iFood](https://www.ifood.com.br) in Recife, PE 🏖 .

- 🔭 I’m currently working on things that involve [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and its ecosystem.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and its ecosystem, how can I share my knowledge in a more accessible way (*e.g. for disabled person*) and how can I have a healthier and more balanced life.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects and points that help to have more diversity in the IT area and in our lives.
- 👨🏾‍🏫 I try to help with my knowledge and my experience, so that I can help people not to go through the same problems that I did.
- 💬 Ask me about [Flutter](https://flutter.dev), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev), or better, [*how can I help you?*](mailto:hi@samuelematias.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Hi%20Samuca!).
- 📫 How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/samuelematias) / [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuelematias/).
- 😄 Pronouns: [he/him/his](http://pronoun.is/he).
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I turn on the camera flashlight, I pronounce the word *"Lumos"* and when I turn off the camera flashlight, I pronounce the word *"Nox"* ***#HP***.
